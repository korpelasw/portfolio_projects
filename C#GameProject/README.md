This Game Project is 2D platformer made with C#
I created my own sprites for playable character, enemies, gems and tile objects.  
Player has to collect the gem in each level to progress to next one. The levels include platforming challenges, and moving enemies.  
Player has ability to jump and also the character can shoot enemies.  
I created the game's levels with text files using layout method. I assigned each tile spirte to have their own letter and created the levels using those letters (example, L = lavatile).
