This Game Project is 2D platformer made with C#
I created my own sprites for playable character, enemies, gems and tile objects.  
Player has to collect the gem in each level to progress to next one. The levels include platforming challenges, and moving enemies.  
Player has ability to jump and also the character can shoot enemies.  
The levels I made creating text files with tilemap layout using my own tile-sprites.
